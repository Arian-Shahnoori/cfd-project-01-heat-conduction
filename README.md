# CFD Project 01: Steady Two-Dimensional Heat Conduction

### A Second-Order Finite-Volume Solver using the Point Gauss-Seidel Method

## Overview

This project presents a numerical solution of the two-dimensional steady-state heat conduction (Laplace) equation on a square domain. The governing equation is discretized using a second-order cell-centered Finite Volume Method (FVM) and solved iteratively with the Point Gauss-Seidel algorithm.

The numerical implementation is verified by comparison with the analytical solution of the Laplace equation under prescribed Dirichlet boundary conditions. The repository contains the complete Python implementation, the full technical report written in LaTeX, and all figures used for verification and post-processing.

## Governing Equation

The physical problem is governed by the two-dimensional Laplace equation

$$
\nabla^2T=
\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2}
+
\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial y^2}
=0
$$

subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on all four boundaries of the computational domain.

For the selected boundary conditions, the analytical solution is

$$
T(x,y)=
\frac{\sin(\pi x)\sinh(\pi y)}
{\sinh(\pi)}.
$$

This analytical solution provides an exact reference for verification of the numerical solver.

## Numerical Method

The implementation consists of

* Cell-centered Finite Volume Method
* Structured Cartesian mesh
* Second-order spatial discretization
* Ghost-cell implementation of Dirichlet boundary conditions
* Point Gauss-Seidel iterative solver
* Residual monitoring using the L₂ norm

The residual norm used for convergence assessment is

$$
L_2=
\left(
\frac{1}{N_{CV}}
\sum_{i=1}^{N_{CV}}R_i^2
\right)^{1/2}.
$$

### Error Distribution

![Error Field](CFD_Project_01_Heat_Conduction/report/latex/figures/error_field.png)

The numerical error remains small across the domain and exhibits the expected behavior of a second-order spatial discretization.

### Residual Convergence

![Residual History](CFD_Project_01_Heat_Conduction/report/latex/figures/residual_history.png)

The Point Gauss-Seidel solver converges monotonically until the prescribed residual tolerance is satisfied.
